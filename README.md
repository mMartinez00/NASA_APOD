# NASA Astronomy Picture of The Day

Having an interest in astronomy, I created a slideshow with images provided by the [NASA APOD API](https://api.nasa.gov/). This slideshow contains 6 images. Each image contains:

1. Title
2. Date photo was taken
3. Explanation about the image

By default the program will display the image of todays date. The user is able to view the APOD of the past five days.
